Classroom is a simple online classroom application, which allows educators to
add courses that are made up of various lessons, while students can enroll on these
courses. Additionally, the application will allow students to track their progress
throughout the course, whereas instructors can monitor how many students have
enrolled in/on a course, and how many have completed each course. 
***
Features:
  I developed this application by extending the skeleton application from my previous project, go check it out here (https://github.com/llsaimur/mernsetup).
  I incorporated functionality that allowed users to have multiple roles, including educator and student; to add and publish courses with lessons as an instructor; to enroll on courses and complete
  lessons as a student; and to keep track of course completion progress and enrollment statistics. While implementing these features, I practiced how to extend the full-stack
  component slices that make up the frontendâ€“backend-synced application. I added new features by simply implementing data schemas and models, adding new
  backend APIs, and integrating these with new React components in the frontend to complete the full-stack slice.
