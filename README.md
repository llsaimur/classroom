# Classroom

Classroom is an online learning platform that allows educators to create courses composed of lessons, while students can enroll in these courses and track their progress. Instructors can monitor enrollment numbers and student completion rates for each course.

## Features

- Multiple user roles: **Educator** and **Student**
- Educators can:
  - Add and publish courses with lessons
  - Track course enrollment and completion statistics
- Students can:
  - Enroll in courses
  - Complete lessons and track progress
- Full-stack integration: backend APIs are synced with React frontend components
- Easily extendable architecture for adding new features

> This application was developed by extending a skeleton project from [MERN Setup](https://github.com/llsaimur/mernsetup). New features were added by creating data schemas and models, implementing backend APIs, and integrating them with React frontend components to complete full-stack slices.
